# Memmap IPC Library

The library is intended for very high-speed raw bitstream interprocess communication.
The repo has bundled a subset of boost along with this library to allow for a one-step build.
In order to test the throughput on your system, open the project in Visual Studio (tested with 2012),
set the test settings to x64 (the tests will only run in 64 bit), and click run all tests.
Some tests can take as long as 5 minutes to run. Be patient.

After all of the tests have finished, click on any of the benchmark tests that you want to see
more information about and click on the output link at the bottom of the test window.

If you have any questions, or wish to submit a bug report, please contact me at jake.k.nielsen@gmail.com

Enjoy.
